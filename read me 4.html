          <h3> Momo</h3>
          <h4> Gyuhaeng's</h4>
          <h5> "Momo" is known to many people as a fairy tale that only children
            read. However, to those people, I would like to say, "If this book
            fits the children's level, I'm not even born yet." This book has a
            lot to think about, and fun . So when you read this book, you might
            feel "time flies."<br>
            <br>
            The plot of this book is a little hard to summarize. And if I
            summarize the plot, there is a possibility of spoilers, so I just
            want to tell you what I felt after reading this book.<br>
            <br>
            Often, the book's introduction includes the phrase "Adult's World
            from a Child's View." Of course, a child who sees the world in this
            way may be called a genius. Anyway to put it to the point, it means
            "a criticism of the current society from a pure perspective."<br>
            <br>
            Time and relationship. These two things, naturally, become more and
            more complicated as they reach adulthood. But it also become rather
            monotonous in some ways. "Spend the time you need." "Maintain
            helpful relationships with humans." With these two things.<br>
            <br>
            The main character, "Momo," criticizes both "time needed" and "a
            helpful human being." which consist unmatched modifiers and nouns.
            Because it is so attractive, I've read this book as many as six
            times.<br>
            <br>
            I always answer with this book to the question of "what I should
            read at least once in my life". It's a book that's that interesting
            and makes you look back on your life. </h5>

          <h3> We are the ants</h3>
          <h4> Nikolas's</h4>
          <h5> "'We Are The Ants' tells a beautiful story of a boy grappling
            with the lost of his best friend. As he struggles to cope, he is
            given the opportunity to erase Earth from a dream-like alien. His
            journey through his pain and existential dread hit close to home and
            created many teary-eyed moments. It is a must read."</h5>
